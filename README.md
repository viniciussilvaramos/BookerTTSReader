An application made in ionic that speaks the text of a PDF file

This is an app that I made in 2015, using Ionic, PDF.js, Angular, Bootstrap, PouchDB and Cordova Bindings for TextToSpeech and BackgroudSound for Android. I tested it only in Android 5.0. The objective of this App was to list all pdf files from the user phone and, when the user selects a file, the application extracts the text from the page using the PDF.js.

After that, the text is converted to voice using the TextToSpeech available for all Android phones. The application is able to save the last page, the last paragraph and the last word that the user has stopped. In addition, the application came with the possibility of playing a background song while the text was read.
